Hey there, I'm Eduardo Antunes. I've been passionate about tech and software
development for many years. My main interests in the field are: operating
systems (particularly Linux), compilers, low level programming languages,
backend development, and cybersecurity. I'm also enthusiastic about free
software, believing in the notion that all knowledge ought to be shared with
others.

I work on some personal projects occasionally, and you can find some of them
here (not all complete - life gets in the way, unfortunately), but I'm
trying out [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/eduardo-antunes) as an alternative.
Check it out if you want to see more recent stuff from me. That will be all,
thanks for your time.
